      This is a simple matching memory game with an added word recall challenge.<br><br><br>

      Visuospatial processing diminishes with age and the loss of this skill is a major component of cognitive decline.<br><br><br>

      <b>Eidetic memory</b> is the ability to recall information from memory after only a few moments of exposure without using an mnemonic device.<br><br>
      Perhaps training this "memory" can help ward off the loss of visuospatial processing we experience with aging.<br><br>

      This game will test the player's ability to recall a word after the matching game.<br><br>

      Upon starting the game, the screen will display a word for a few seconds.<br>

      Then the word will disappear, replaced with game board of 16 tiles.<br>

      When clicked the tile will flip, displaying a character. The player will select a second tile.<br>
      If the tiles are a match, they will disapper from play.<br>

      If they are not a match, the tiles will flip back over.<br><br>

      The player must match all eight pairs of characters.<br><br>

      Once all pairs are matched, the player will be asked to recall the initial word.<br>

      The player must select the word that appeared initially in order to "win" the round.<br><br>
