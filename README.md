# eidetic-memory-game
--Initial functionality--

This is a simple color matching memory game with a neat-o twist!

Eidetic memory is the ability to recall information from memory after only a few moments of exposure without using an mnemonic device.

Visuospatial processing diminishes with age and the loss of this skill is a major component of cognitive decline.

This game will test the player's ability to recall a word after a color matching game.

Upon starting the game, the screen will display a word for a few seconds.

The word will then disappear and the game board with 16 tiles will appear.

If clicked, the tile will flip, displaying a character. The player will then select  second tile. If the tiles are a match, they will remain face up. If they are not a match, the tiles will flip back over.

The player must match all eight pairs of characters.

Once all eight pairs are matched, the board will disappear and will be replaced with a menu of words.

The player must select the word that appeared initially in order to "win" the round. If the player does not select the correct word, the game restarts with the original word and 16 tiles.


--Increased functionality--

Rounds will increase in difficulty.

Rounds two will increase the tiles to be matched on the game board. Player will need to remember initial word after matching 16 pairs from 32 tiles.

Round three will ask the player to remember an additional word and have the player match 16 pairs from 32 tiles.

Round four will ask the player to remember both words and match 32 pairs.
